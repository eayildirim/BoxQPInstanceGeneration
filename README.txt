We consider the box-constrained quadratic program (BoxQP) given by

min{0.5*x'*Q*x + c'*x: 0 <= x <= e},

where e denotes the vector of all ones. 

This repository contains the set of instances generated by Algorithms 1 
through 4 in the following paper:

(i) Algorithm 1 generates an instance of (BoxQP) that admits an exact RLT 
Relaxation.

(ii) Algorithm 2 generates an instance of (BoxQP) that admits an inexact RLT
Relaxation.

(iii) Algorithm 3 generates an instance of (BoxQP) that admits an exact SDP-RLT
Relaxation.

(iv) Algorithm 4 generates an instance of (BoxQP) that admits an exact SDP-RLT
Relaxation but an inexact RLT Relaxation.

(1) codes/

instance_generator_algorithm_X.jl is the Julia code that generates an 
instance of (BoxQP) by Algorithm X and solves it by CPLEX.


(2) InstancesFromAlgotihmX/nY/

contains the set of instances of (BoxQP) generated by Algorithm X in 
dimension Y.

(2a) nY-aX-insZ.txt is the data of the instance generated by Algorithm X in
dimension Y using seed number Z. The format is as follows:
